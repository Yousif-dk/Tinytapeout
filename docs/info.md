## How it works

This is a simple 4 bit adder circuit. I built it out of the following digital logic gates:
AND
XOR
OR
It has a 5 bit output to handle overflow.

## How to test
The inputs are elementwise pairs. So the first two input pins will be the least significant bit of both numbers. The next two input pins will be the second least significant bit of both numbers. 

If you'd like to test it, two a 4 bit number addition on paper, and try to do it using the circuit. the results should be the same
